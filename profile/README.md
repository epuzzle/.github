# 🧩 ePuzzle — Open eCommerce Development Team

**ePuzzle** stands for **eCommerce Puzzle** —  
a team dedicated to building smart, flexible, and human-centric eCommerce solutions.  

We believe that eCommerce should be **modular, transparent, and made for people**,  
not just for businesses. That’s why we release many of our tools and integrations for free.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **ePuzzle = eCommerce + Puzzle**  
> Every project is a piece of a bigger system —
